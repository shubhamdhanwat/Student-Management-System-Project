# Student-Management-System-Project
Student Record System

This is your major project and can be done using concepts that we studied in class. Please take 4-5 days and complete it.
Since we have covered the OOPS concepts in class, you have to use them now, to create a simple Student Record System.

Use Classes and Objects concepts to create Student class, and array/vector of objects, and write suitable member functions as well. Here are some of the functionalities that your code should have:

1. For Classes 1-5 only.
2. Assume the person that'll be using this system are school teachers.
3. Add student record - Teacher should be able to add a student record in any class.
4. Search student record - Teacher should be able to search for a student record in a class using the rollNumber of that student, this will return all the details associated with a student.
5. Modify student record - Teacher should be able to modify a student record in any class.
6. Generate mark sheet - Since the Student class will also store marks of the students, the teacher should be able to generate a detailed mark sheet of any student.
7. Delete student record - Teacher should be able to delete a student record in any class.
8. Change password - Before the teacher starts using our system, make sure he/she enters a username and password to login. Use a map to store credentials of 4-5 teachers. Now, a teacher should also be able to change her password.
